- 👋 Hi, I’m @timunderwood9
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, databases, SQL, using LLMs to improve productivity and enhance my learning, and finding a coding job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I really would like to contribute at laest a few merges and doc updates to an open source project while I'm still in my learning phase. A chance to do something useful while at the same time stretching my abilities.
- 📫 How to reach me? My email is the easiest / most consistent way, it is my user name with an @gmail attached to it.
